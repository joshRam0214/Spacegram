## Tech Used
- React.js
- Sass
- Bootstrap
- Netlify

- Users can hide and unhide like images to provide more space on the browser to view searched images.
- Images that the user likes can be saved automatically, so when users decide to leave the page and return, they will see the pictures they have selected.
