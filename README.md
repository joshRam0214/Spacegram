React was used to build this application. The basic functionality was provided at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AZO0BZwn1Aogj4f3PDNe1mhq8pKsXZxtrG--EIbP_-w/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AZO0BZwn1Aogj4f3PDNe1mhq8pKsXZxtrG--EIbP_-w/edit#). Some additional changes were made to make the UI more appealing. An example would removing bullet points and putting each movie in a box. Also, using a checkbox to give the user the option to see the movie poster that they searched for.
